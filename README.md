### Getting Started with Google Colab

To start experimenting with these algorithms and mathematical methods:

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload the `README.md` file or copy code directly from this document.
3. Run each cell in Colab and modify parameters as needed to explore the behavior and performance of each method.

**Requirements**: Some algorithms may require specific libraries, such as `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `tensorflow`, or `ultralytics` (for YOLO). Install dependencies in Colab by running:
```python
!pip install -q scikit-learn xgboost tensorflow ultralytics
```
